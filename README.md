# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-FINAL PROJECT
Tory Bartelloni

The script was created to match the criteria of the class project in the most simple way that I know how. There is some minor redundancy that can be found, but overall it is clean, short, and accomplishes the goals as I interpreted them.

I have detailed my rationale for each section of the script below. The sections named and described here are also marked in the script file using comments above the portion of the script it is "naming".
